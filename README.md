# Project Description
    This project will be used to track time spent on various hobbies based on a user set goal. As the user logs time there will be a sprite figure that will be loaded and have various facial expressions depending if you are on track to your goal or not. The program will track time spent on the hobby over an entire week and use a graph to visualize time tracked.
# Target Platform
