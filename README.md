# Project Description
    This project will be used to track time spent on
    various hobbies based on a user set goal. As the
    user logs time there will be a sprite figure that
    will be loaded and have various facial expressions
    depending if you are on track to your goal or not.
    The program will track time spent on the hobby
    over an entire week and use a graph to visualize time tracked.
# Target Platform
    This program will implement languages such as Python,
    HTML, Django, and potentially JavaScript. Furthermore
    this program will work as a webapp that runs
    in a local environment.
